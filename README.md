# Logic app
(better name needed)

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to provide a platform for generic logic operations (checking for consistency, validity, explanations, etc.) by way of an easy-to-use DSL. 

## Mission
The purpose is achieved by way of three parts:
- The DSL specification and generator (`za.org.cair.logic_app`)
- An IDE plugin (`za.org.cair.logic_app.ide`)
- A webapp editor (`za.org.cair.logic_app.web`)
